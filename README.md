# LinkedList

For this project I solved appending, prepending, removing, searching, and printing the bids. I began with the appending and prepending. Then, I moved on to the search, followed by the remove function. Lastly, I printed the bids. To overcome roadblocks, I exercised my right to use the tutor center, when Google and Youtube got me nowhere. I learned to use the pseudocode from the classwork to assist with writing the actual code, instead of following the pseudocode in the assingment. I learned to start with what is needed for the other to work. As in, I had to write the search function before the remove because you cannot remove a bid without the ability to search for it first.
