# LinkedList

What was the problem you were solving in the projects for this course?
For this project I solved appending, prepending, removing, searching, and printing the bids.
How did you approach the problem? Consider why data structures are important to understand.
I began with the appending and prepending. Then, I moved on to the search, followed by the remove function. Lastly, I printed the bids.
How did you overcome any roadblocks you encountered while going through the activities or project?
To overcome roadblocks, I exercised my right to use the tutor center, when Google and Youtube got me nowhere.
How has your work on this project expanded your approach to designing software and developing programs?
I learned to use the pseudocode from the classwork to assist with writing the actual code, instead of following the pseudocode in the assingment.
How has your work on this project evolved the way you write programs that are maintainable, readable, and adaptable?
I learned to start with what is needed for the other to work. As in, I had to write the search function before the remove because you cannot remove a bid without the ability to search for it first.
